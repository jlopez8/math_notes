    "We are demoing the process of taking handwritten math and converting to LaTeX using the top tools found in the research phase. The writing and input will be done using tkinter, where writing will occur in a separate window. The math OCR will be done with MathPix's OCR API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first test of the full workflow produced a rendered equation from a handwritten input whith about 9/11 characacters correctly. I recognize two problems contributing to this inaccuracy. The first, is the canvas drawing is not the exact image being sent. A background PIL canvas is silently keeping track of the drawing using line objects native to PIL. These objects are not presented as smoothly as the tkinter counterparts see image 2 and image 3. Another source of error is inaccurate user input, ie, bad handwriting.  \n",
