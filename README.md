MathNotes
==========


MathNotes is a tool that allows the user to integrate natural handwritten math with digital notetaking using a Jupyter notebook.

A user can write hand-written mathematics on a canvas directly in a cell. They are given the option to save a canvas and or send a prediction request to translate this text to a LaTeX format for visualization or exportation.

MathNotes requires a MathPix account for OCR predictions. An account can be created [here](https://accounts.mathpix.com/signup).  A free account is available up to 50 free API requests. An APP ID and APP KEY pair are specified during the setup for MathNotes.
